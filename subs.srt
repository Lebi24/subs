00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,453
Ow.

3
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:14,198
Should pale death
with treble dread

4
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:17,436
make the ocean caves
our bed,

5
00:07:17,502 --> 00:07:20,138
God who hear'st
the surges roll,

6
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:22,806
deign to save
our suppliant soul.

7
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,343
To four weeks!

8
00:07:25,843 --> 00:07:27,177
No, sir. Thank you.

9
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:31,316
It's bad luck to leave
a toast unfinished, lad.

10
00:07:31,382 --> 00:07:34,218
Oh, meanin'...
Meanin' no disrespect.

11
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:37,588
Man what don't drink,
best have his reasons.

12
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,960
Uh... Ain't it...

13
00:07:42,192 --> 00:07:45,764
I... I understood it's
against regulations, sir.

14
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,199
Did you?

15
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,968
I did, sir. From, uh...
From them's manual.

16
00:07:50,035 --> 00:07:52,737
Didn't picture you
a readin' man.

17
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:57,175
Well, I ain't trying
for trouble.

18
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:59,311
Then you'll do
as I say.

19
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:01,713
That's in yer book too.

20
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,317
To four weeks.

21
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:52,863
Aye. Aye. The cistern
needs a-lookin' to.

22
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:54,232
One of yer duties, lad.

23
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:57,336
Or didn't y'read
yerself about it?

24
00:08:57,402 --> 00:09:00,004
You'll clean the brass
and the clockwork,

25
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:02,606
and you'll tidy up
the quarters after.

26
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:06,043
And there's well more
to be mended outside.

27
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,779
D'y'hear me, lad?

28
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:09,680
Yes, sir.

29
00:09:09,746 --> 00:09:11,250
Aye, sir!

30
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,586
Aye, sir.

31
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:23,226
When the fog clears,

32
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:25,463
you'll work through
the dog watch.

33
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:32,070
Doggin' it? I was 'specting
I'd git up to see the lantern.

34
00:09:32,136 --> 00:09:33,438
I tend the light.

35
00:09:35,506 --> 00:09:37,341
Well, the rules is
alternatin' shifts.

36
00:09:37,408 --> 00:09:40,311
It's the mid watch
that's to dread, lad.

37
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:44,116
My watch,
night to morning.

38
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:47,753
Some new junior man
I'm fixed with.

39
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,723
See to yer duties.
The light is mine.

40
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,822
Son of a bitch!

41
00:11:37,828 --> 00:11:41,866
To ye, me beauty.

42
00:13:50,227 --> 00:13:51,662
Shingles.

43
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,936
Tend to 'em
after the cistern.

44
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,240
And the lamp,
she needs oil.

45
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:08,646
Aye, sir.

46
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,819
Go!

47
00:17:03,187 --> 00:17:04,556
Move it.

48
00:18:57,969 --> 00:18:59,837
You don't go in there!

49
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,977
- Oil, sir.
- Tired? Use this next time.

50
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:09,380
Save you
a helluva lot of trouble.

51
00:19:10,013 --> 00:19:11,982
Catch yer breath, lad.

52
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:19,222
I said,
catch yer breath, lad.

53
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,091
Then bring that drum

54
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:25,863
back down the ladderwell
where y'found it.

55
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,000
'Less ye're fixin' to burn
the whole light down.

56
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,740
Then see to the rest
of yer duties.

57
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:39,144
Ye're behindhand already.

58
00:19:40,377 --> 00:19:43,747
- Aye, sir.
- Ye're too slow. You a dullard?

59
00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:45,817
No, sir.

60
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:47,284
Fooled me.

61
00:19:58,695 --> 00:20:01,465
Should pale death
with treble dread

62
00:20:01,532 --> 00:20:04,435
make the ocean caves
our bed,

63
00:20:04,501 --> 00:20:06,836
God who hear'st
the surges roll,

64
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:09,874
deign to save
the suppliant soul.

65
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:21,786
Still tastes o'the head?

66
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:26,758
Ah, find some chirk
in ye, lad.

67
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:29,494
Now is the time
for gab and chatter.

68
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:31,294
Y'best be enjoying it.

69
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:33,931
Come a fortnight and the
brace of us'll be wantin'

70
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:37,567
to be ever silent
as the tomb.

71
00:20:37,634 --> 00:20:39,104
I ain't much for talkin'.

72
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,806
Reckon ye're the first?

73
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,374
No, sir. I don't.

74
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:45,076
Y'ain't.

75
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,411
Y'ain't.

76
00:20:49,278 --> 00:20:53,983
<i>The Chicopee,</i>
a fine-un she were.

77
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:57,288
Clean-built
and trig-lookin'!

78
00:20:57,355 --> 00:21:00,991
None more fleet in '64
than she.

79
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:03,926
We were on the breaks...

80
00:21:03,993 --> 00:21:06,330
A mutiny, it were...

81
00:21:06,396 --> 00:21:08,464
And why, ask ye? Why?

82
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:14,471
What's the terrible part of
a sailor's life, ask ye, lad?

83
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:17,875
'Tis when the work stops when
ye're twixt wind and water.

84
00:21:17,942 --> 00:21:20,611
Doldrums. Doldrums.

85
00:21:20,676 --> 00:21:22,679
Eviler than the Devil.

86
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:24,883
Boredom makes men
to villains,

87
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:27,885
and the water
goes quick, lad, vanished.

88
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:33,857
The only med'cine is drink.

89
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:36,359
Keeps them sailors happy,
keeps 'em agreeable,

90
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:38,261
keeps 'em calm,
keeps 'em...

91
00:21:38,328 --> 00:21:39,496
Stupid.

92
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:49,673
Curse me if there ain't
an old tar spirit

93
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,543
somewheres in ye, lad.

94
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:02,220
Out with it, lad.

95
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:05,522
Uh...

96
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:09,394
What, uh... What made
your last keeper leave?

97
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,162
Him? Me second?

98
00:22:11,962 --> 00:22:13,330
Mmm-hmm.

99
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:16,100
Died.

100
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:18,568
Went mad, he did.

101
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:23,240
Ravin' about sirens, merfolk,
bad omens and the like.

102
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:24,708
In the end,

103
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:29,346
weren't no more sense left
in him than an hen's tooth.

104
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:34,652
He believed that there was
some enchantment in the light.

105
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:37,888
He notioned that St. Elmo

106
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:40,524
had cast
his very fire into it.

107
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:46,564
Salvation, said he.

108
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:58,610
Tall tales.

109
00:23:03,413 --> 00:23:06,116
I seen ye
sparrin' with a gull.

110
00:23:07,718 --> 00:23:10,021
Best leave 'em be.

111
00:23:10,087 --> 00:23:12,388
Bad luck to kill a sea bird.

112
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,425
More tall tales.

113
00:23:17,761 --> 00:23:19,463
Bad luck to kill a sea bird!

114
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:31,408
Pay me no mind, lad.

115
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:33,244
None.

116
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:36,614
Fix us up some coffee.

117
00:23:38,682 --> 00:23:40,351
Long night ahead.

118
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:44,521
Drop o'coffee
will do us good.

119
00:25:48,511 --> 00:25:51,148
You've been neglecting
yer duties, lad!

120
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,718
Don't deny it!

121
00:25:55,786 --> 00:25:57,188
What do you call that?

122
00:25:58,855 --> 00:26:01,625
- Sir?
- What?

123
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:04,028
I... I mopped and swept
twice over, sir.

124
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:05,763
Ye lyin' dog.

125
00:26:08,231 --> 00:26:11,201
- I swept 'em.
- 'Tis begrimed and bedabbled.

126
00:26:11,268 --> 00:26:13,269
Unwiped, unwashed,
and distained.

127
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:17,442
You git some kinda peart
outta molestin' me?

128
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:18,675
Come now?

129
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:21,445
I already said...

130
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:23,212
How dare ye contradict me,
y'dog.

131
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,615
Now look here,

132
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:26,584
I ain't never intended
to be no housewife

133
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,819
nor slave
in takin' this job.

134
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:30,887
It ain't right!

135
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:32,822
These lodgings is
more ramshackle

136
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:35,726
than any shanty boy's camp
I ever seen.

137
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,661
The Queen of England's
own fancy housekeeper

138
00:26:37,728 --> 00:26:39,329
couldn't even done no better
than what I done,

139
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:40,696
'cause I tell you,
I scrubbed

140
00:26:40,763 --> 00:26:42,899
this here place
twice over, sir...

141
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,201
And I say y'did nothin'
o'the sort.

142
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:47,471
And I say,
y'swab it again,

143
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:49,306
and y'swab it
proper-like this time,

144
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:53,611
and you'll be swabbin' it
10 times more after that.

145
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:56,246
And if I tells ye
to pull up and apart

146
00:26:56,313 --> 00:26:58,682
every floorboard and clapboard
of this here house

147
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:00,483
and scour 'em down
with yer bare,

148
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,720
bleedin' knuckles,
you'll do it!

149
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:06,256
And if I tells ye to yank out
every single nail

150
00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:08,392
from every moulderin'
nail-hole

151
00:27:08,458 --> 00:27:10,961
and suck off
every spec of rust

152
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:15,565
till all them nails sparkle
like a sperm whale's pecker,

153
00:27:15,632 --> 00:27:18,702
and then carpenter
the whole light station

154
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:20,136
back together from scrap,

155
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:23,072
and then do it all over again,
you'll do it!

156
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,675
And by God and by Golly,

157
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,211
you'll do it smilin', lad,
'cause you'll like it.

158
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:29,846
You'll like it
'cause I says you will!

159
00:27:32,616 --> 00:27:37,454
Contradict me again,
and I'll dock yer wages.

160
00:27:39,423 --> 00:27:40,892
D'ye hear me, lad?

161
00:27:43,193 --> 00:27:44,528
Aye, sir.

162
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:46,831
Ah.

163
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:49,099
Swab, dog.

164
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:50,534
Swab!

165
00:29:08,412 --> 00:29:11,148
Keep 'em steady, lad.

166
00:29:11,214 --> 00:29:12,715
Aye, sir.

167
00:29:12,782 --> 00:29:15,318
Whitewash
must be even, lad.

168
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:17,187
Bright! Shinin'!

169
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:19,455
Like a silver
whorehouse token.

170
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:21,457
Give them sailors
a proper daymark.

171
00:29:21,525 --> 00:29:25,095
They're not going
to see it in a goddamn storm!

172
00:29:25,162 --> 00:29:27,498
Keep your temper now, lad.

173
00:29:27,564 --> 00:29:28,966
'Tis fine work.

174
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,834
And ye're makin' high marks
in me logbook.

175
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:33,371
Them's gospel!

176
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:36,573
I'll drop y'down
a few feet.

177
00:29:38,942 --> 00:29:40,376
Easy!

178
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:42,779
Never been in better hands.

179
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,450
Easy!

180
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:48,384
Quit yer flailing, lad.

181
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:50,119
- I ain't!
- Y'are!

182
00:29:50,186 --> 00:29:52,221
- Keep still!
- I am!

183
00:30:23,987 --> 00:30:26,957
Git! Git! Git! Git!

184
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,595
Thank ye, lad.

185
00:31:05,828 --> 00:31:07,097
Winslow.

186
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:10,734
Ephraim Winslow.

187
00:31:11,468 --> 00:31:13,604
These last two weeks, I'd...

188
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,972
I'd like it
if you'd call me by my name.

189
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:19,009
Listen to ye,

190
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:20,943
giving orders, lad.

191
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:24,248
- Winslow.
- All right, all right.

192
00:31:24,314 --> 00:31:27,617
Suits me just as fine,
Ephraim Winslow.

193
00:31:27,683 --> 00:31:33,891
So, what brung such a one
as ye to this damned rock?

194
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:36,326
Such as what?

195
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:38,795
Pretty as a picture.

196
00:31:38,862 --> 00:31:41,665
Only joshing, lad,
only josh...

197
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:43,901
- Winslow.
- Winslow.

198
00:31:46,068 --> 00:31:47,436
What brung ye...

199
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:53,910
...to this rock,
Ephraim Winslow?

200
00:31:56,578 --> 00:31:58,648
What were yer work afore?

201
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:02,418
- Timber.
- Timber?

202
00:32:02,486 --> 00:32:05,990
Big timber. Up north.
Canada ways.

203
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:09,026
- Hudson Bay outfit?
- The same.

204
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:10,460
True what they say?

205
00:32:10,527 --> 00:32:12,996
"Forest as far
as the eye can see"?

206
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:17,434
Yessir. Spruce, tamarack,
white pine.

207
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:19,435
"Bush," them folk
up there call it.

208
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:22,005
Had enough of trees,
that it, then?

209
00:32:22,071 --> 00:32:23,173
Yes, sir.

210
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,741
Can't say I blame ye.

211
00:32:25,808 --> 00:32:28,144
I hearn tell
about that life.

212
00:32:28,211 --> 00:32:29,712
Hard goin'.

213
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:33,517
Workin' one man harder
than two hosses, they say.

214
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,786
No thankee.

215
00:32:37,887 --> 00:32:42,992
The sea, she's the only
situation wantin' fer me.

216
00:32:45,796 --> 00:32:47,364
Miss it?

217
00:32:47,431 --> 00:32:51,800
Ain't nothing
what can touch it.

218
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:53,269
But I can't...

219
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:56,006
be draggin'
me old stump about.

220
00:32:56,873 --> 00:32:59,776
Nay. Not worth the trouble...

221
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:03,846
Now I'm a wickie
and a wickie I is.

222
00:33:03,913 --> 00:33:07,984
And I'm damn-well wedded
to this here light,

223
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:12,355
and she's been a finer,
truer, quieter wife

224
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:14,924
than any alive-blooded woman.

225
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,795
Y'ever married?

226
00:33:19,895 --> 00:33:22,566
Thirteen Christmases at sea...

227
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,603
Little 'uns at home.

228
00:33:26,702 --> 00:33:28,605
She never forgave it.

229
00:33:31,273 --> 00:33:33,742
'Tis fer the better.

230
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:38,315
Since we're getting
too friendly, Ephraim Winslow,

231
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:43,821
tell me, what's a timber man
want with being a wickie?

232
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:51,761
Not enough quiet
for ye up north?

233
00:33:51,827 --> 00:33:53,829
Sawdust itching yer nethers?

234
00:33:53,896 --> 00:33:56,399
Foreman found ye
too high-tempered

235
00:33:56,465 --> 00:33:58,134
for carrying an axe?

236
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:03,908
Like you said, I just had
enough of trees, I guess.

237
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,749
Since I left Dad,

238
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:14,952
I done every kind of work
that can pay a man.

239
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:16,852
Some I ain't near proud of.

240
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,990
- Drifter, eh?
- No, just...

241
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:23,527
Can't find a post
I can take a real shine to,

242
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,461
so I keep movin' along.

243
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:26,896
And I ain't the kind
to look back

244
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:28,598
- at what's behind him, see.
- On the run?

245
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:30,565
Now look here,

246
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:33,170
ain't nothin' wrong with a man
startin' fresh, startin' new,

247
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:34,471
just lookin'
to earn a living...

248
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:36,240
No...

249
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:38,375
Just like any man,

250
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,744
just wanna settle down
quiet-like with some earnings.

251
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,514
I read someplace that

252
00:34:44,581 --> 00:34:46,916
a man could earn 630...

253
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,952
I read $1,000 a year

254
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:52,188
if he tends a light
far off shore.

255
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:55,591
The further away,
the more he earns.

256
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:59,663
I read that, and hell,
I says, work.

257
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,365
Save my earnings.

258
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:08,438
Sometime soon
I'll raise my own roof,

259
00:35:08,503 --> 00:35:09,873
somewheres up country,

260
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,376
with no one to tell me
"what for".

261
00:35:13,476 --> 00:35:14,845
And that's all.

262
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:22,152
Same old, borin' story, eh?

263
00:35:24,521 --> 00:35:26,123
Well, you asked.

264
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:37,366
Say, why is it bad luck
to kill a gull?

265
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:42,006
In 'em's the souls of sailors
what met their maker.

266
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:46,943
You a prayin' man, Winslow?

267
00:35:48,911 --> 00:35:51,513
Not as often as I might.

268
00:35:51,581 --> 00:35:54,751
But I'm God-fearin',
if that's what you're askin'.

269
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,998
Shit.

270
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:34,657
Wind's changed.

271
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:37,894
- Oh. Good riddance.
- Oh, don't be so darn foolish.

272
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,629
It's the calm
afore the storm, Winslow.

273
00:41:40,697 --> 00:41:44,434
She were a gentle
westerly wind ye're cursin'.

274
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:46,369
Only feels roughly

275
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:48,071
'cause you don't know
nothin' about nothin',

276
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:50,672
and there ain't no trees
on this here rock

277
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:53,209
like your Hudson Bay bush.

278
00:41:53,275 --> 00:41:55,478
Nor'Easterly wind'll
come soon

279
00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:57,547
ablowin' like Gabriel's horn.

280
00:41:57,612 --> 00:42:00,683
Best board up
them signal house winders.

281
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,983
Aye, sir.

282
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,586
'Twill keep steady
afore the tender

283
00:42:03,652 --> 00:42:06,021
comes in the morn,
I 'spect...

284
00:42:06,088 --> 00:42:09,326
but there's dirty weather
knockin' about.

285
00:42:13,128 --> 00:42:15,097
Somethin' stirring in ye?

286
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,735
Ye're gettin' off this rock
tomorry. Winslow.

287
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:21,737
Don't start grudgen me now.

288
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:24,105
No, sir.

289
00:42:24,172 --> 00:42:26,308
Keeping secrets, are ye?

290
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:32,014
I could just use a hand
with them boards, is all.

291
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:45,161
Pull, Winslow!

292
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:50,766
Look at 'em!

293
00:42:51,967 --> 00:42:54,103
Better than fin fishin'!

294
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:03,179
Ain't no crime
to take a snort now.

295
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:07,150
A clear night.
And our last afore relief.

296
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:09,085
I ain't never know'd
an inspector

297
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:12,288
what wouldn't turn
a blind eye.

298
00:43:12,355 --> 00:43:16,092
And I won't
take no for an answer.

299
00:43:23,632 --> 00:43:27,870
Should pale death
and treble dread...

300
00:43:29,438 --> 00:43:32,442
Ah, hell!
To... To relief!

301
00:43:32,507 --> 00:43:34,677
And how!

302
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,815
Oh!

303
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:58,734
<i>♪ Hurrah,

311
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,286
...and a pretty lass,
she were,

312
00:44:16,351 --> 00:44:18,487
takin' off her bonnet,

313
00:44:18,554 --> 00:44:21,356
but as I says,
I'd broke me leg,

314
00:44:21,423 --> 00:44:23,358
and banged myself all up.

315
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:26,563
It was
to a nuns' hospital...

316
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,766
All of them nuns
were Catholics, I tell ye.

317
00:44:35,438 --> 00:44:38,775
But I never went
to Salem since

318
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,911
without hoping
that I should see her,

319
00:44:41,978 --> 00:44:46,282
for beddin' down
wer'nt the same since.

320
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,021
You feel shame
when you lie with a woman?

321
00:44:52,088 --> 00:44:53,723
I ain't 'shamed
of nothing!

322
00:44:58,226 --> 00:45:00,429
Well, I'll say it...

323
00:45:00,496 --> 00:45:03,767
I might even miss ye,
Ephraim Winslow.

324
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:08,338
Ye're fastly a true blue wickie

325
00:45:08,403 --> 00:45:10,106
in the making, you is.

326
00:45:10,172 --> 00:45:11,940
Thought one night
you was bound to

327
00:45:12,007 --> 00:45:13,442
split me skull in twain,

328
00:45:13,509 --> 00:45:15,510
but ye're a good-un.

329
00:45:15,577 --> 00:45:19,282
Why, you'll be workin'
the lamp in no time.

330
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,718
Why haven't I?

331
00:45:22,784 --> 00:45:23,920
What?

332
00:45:24,588 --> 00:45:25,822
The light.

333
00:45:32,594 --> 00:45:34,529
I'm the keeper of this station, lad.

334
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:36,966
Some other station,
y'can tend the light.

335
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:38,400
The manual says...

336
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:40,169
My log is the only book
on this rock...

337
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:42,871
I'm the keeper
of the light, lad,

338
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:44,673
I never let
no man touch her...

339
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:47,777
Don't concern yerself
with the beacon, lad!

340
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:49,278
Mine!

341
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:02,992
Have it your way.

342
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:15,403
Say, I never...

343
00:46:16,304 --> 00:46:18,807
I don't...
I don't know your name.

344
00:46:19,775 --> 00:46:21,010
Wake.

345
00:46:21,943 --> 00:46:23,545
Your Christian name.

346
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:26,815
Thomas.

347
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:31,855
- Thomas?
- Aye, Thomas Wake.

348
00:46:34,157 --> 00:46:35,625
Call me Tom.

349
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:44,867
Well...

350
00:46:47,436 --> 00:46:49,338
To my friend Tom.

351
00:46:51,472 --> 00:46:53,876
And to gittin' off
this goddamned rock!

352
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,574
What'r y'splittin'
yer lungs fer?

353
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:46,275
You smell o' shit.

354
00:50:46,342 --> 00:50:49,612
Best swab this mess
afore the tender comes.

355
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,717
Do as ye're told, lad!
The quarters are dire.

356
00:50:54,784 --> 00:50:56,586
Aye... Aye, sir.

357
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,221
Aye.

358
00:51:44,766 --> 00:51:46,602
They didn't come.

359
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:30,078
The damp's
got to the provisions!

360
00:52:33,682 --> 00:52:34,884
What?

361
00:52:34,951 --> 00:52:37,987
The damp's
got to the provisions!

362
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,275
The damp's
got to the foodstuffs.

363
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:01,210
The salt cod is out.

364
00:53:01,275 --> 00:53:03,178
- Out?
- Blasted.

365
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:05,280
Gone to rot.

366
00:53:05,347 --> 00:53:08,217
- Praised be.
- Will you hear me now?

367
00:53:08,282 --> 00:53:12,121
- Hear what?
- That we best be rationing.

368
00:53:12,186 --> 00:53:15,490
- Rationing?
- You insubordinate again?

369
00:53:15,557 --> 00:53:17,259
It's only been one day.

370
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:18,961
Devil's tail.

371
00:53:20,094 --> 00:53:22,463
Look, maybe the tender
did come.

372
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:24,666
We just missed her, is all.

373
00:53:24,733 --> 00:53:26,369
I can take the dory out.

374
00:53:27,469 --> 00:53:29,371
Weeks, Winslow. Weeks.

375
00:53:30,005 --> 00:53:31,472
What?

376
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:32,807
What do you mean, what?

377
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:35,711
- Weeks?
- Weeks. Aye, weeks.

378
00:53:36,411 --> 00:53:38,012
We slept in. Dead drunk.

379
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,150
It's been weeks ago
since we missed her, Winslow.

380
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:44,320
And I've been askin' ye
to ration fer weeks now, too,

381
00:53:44,385 --> 00:53:47,722
but you've kept barking
at me like a mad dog

382
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:50,558
sayin' you can
"take the dory out."

383
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:51,994
- Now, look here.
- Oh, no.

384
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:54,028
Don't be losing
yer head now.

385
00:53:54,096 --> 00:53:56,197
- This ain't funny.
- No, it ain't.

386
00:53:56,264 --> 00:53:58,533
And I ain't want to be
stranded here

387
00:53:58,601 --> 00:54:00,403
with some damn lunatic.

388
00:54:02,737 --> 00:54:04,405
Stranded?

389
00:54:04,472 --> 00:54:06,808
That's what I said.

390
00:54:06,875 --> 00:54:09,878
Why, I thought...
I thought you said relief was coming.

391
00:54:09,945 --> 00:54:12,981
If we can
wait out the storm.

392
00:54:14,315 --> 00:54:16,752
The tender is coming!

393
00:54:18,152 --> 00:54:19,654
In '75,

394
00:54:19,722 --> 00:54:23,992
Ol' Striker were marooned here
for seven long months, he was.

395
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:25,795
The storm died
on the mainland,

396
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,863
but here, the waters
were too rageful

397
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:30,298
neither to launch
nor land.

398
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:34,503
You're just tryin'
to scare me.

399
00:54:34,570 --> 00:54:37,472
Look at ye. Pretendin'.

400
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:43,346
But ye well know yer lot.

401
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:10,106
Dig!

402
00:55:12,775 --> 00:55:14,309
Dig, says I!

403
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:16,445
Dig!

404
00:55:17,112 --> 00:55:18,347
Dig!

405
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:25,188
There she lies.

406
00:55:46,275 --> 00:55:47,943
Rations.

407
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:51,947
The worst of us couldn't
fend 'gainst the ship rats

408
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:56,052
what gnawed
on the soles of our feet.

409
00:56:00,021 --> 00:56:03,891
Their legs withered
and turned gangree'nous,

410
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:07,596
every shade
of the peacock's tail.

411
00:56:07,663 --> 00:56:09,931
Their gums grew swollen,

412
00:56:09,998 --> 00:56:13,135
the color of bone,
then to rot.

413
00:56:13,202 --> 00:56:15,670
Tarry blood oozed,

414
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:21,010
teeth droppin' to the deck
with none to hold on to.

415
00:56:23,711 --> 00:56:27,949
"Land ho!" hears I,

416
00:56:28,016 --> 00:56:30,751
but only grass
on that island.

417
00:56:30,818 --> 00:56:33,121
So we et upon the grass.

418
00:56:33,188 --> 00:56:35,523
'And 'twas that scurvy

419
00:56:35,590 --> 00:56:38,594
what left me locked
ever since.

420
00:56:40,528 --> 00:56:43,231
I thought you said
you'd broke it.

421
00:56:43,664 --> 00:56:45,233
Aye?

422
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:47,300
Your leg.

423
00:56:47,302 --> 00:56:50,039
Catholic nuns
and such like.

424
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:53,141
You must've misheard.

425
00:57:00,514 --> 00:57:03,618
- I told that dumb bastard...
- Yep.

426
00:57:03,684 --> 00:57:05,320
Them eaves be gonners.

427
00:57:05,387 --> 00:57:08,957
"Give me your cant hook,"
I says to him.

428
00:57:09,023 --> 00:57:13,228
But...
Foreman Winslow,

429
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:16,632
that goddamned
Canady bastard...

430
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:19,800
- Winslow?
- ...always callin' me a dog.

431
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:21,168
A filthy dog.

432
00:57:21,235 --> 00:57:24,806
- I'll show you who's a dog.
- Winslow.

433
00:57:24,873 --> 00:57:28,177
- What about...
- Who, Winslow?

434
00:57:29,077 --> 00:57:30,445
The eaves be fallin'...

435
00:57:30,512 --> 00:57:33,749
- He's always raggin' on me...
- Ragging?

436
00:57:33,815 --> 00:57:35,650
Like you.

437
00:57:35,717 --> 00:57:38,387
Damn fool nonsense.

438
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:40,356
That's the trouble with ye,
Winslow.

439
00:57:40,422 --> 00:57:45,660
Trouble with you is eatin'
grass without no teeth.

440
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,462
Come now?

441
00:57:49,565 --> 00:57:54,202
Your sea matey's teeth
had falled out.

442
00:57:58,039 --> 00:57:59,641
What are ye gettin' at,
Winslow?

443
00:58:01,009 --> 00:58:03,746
Well, it just seems
powerful hard

444
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:10,050
to eat grass with no teeth.

445
00:58:10,117 --> 00:58:13,489
'Cause goats
and sheeps and cows...

446
00:58:13,556 --> 00:58:18,427
Well, now, they all
got teeth, don't they?

447
00:58:20,661 --> 00:58:24,699
Y'know how y'eat grass
without yer teeth?

448
00:58:26,067 --> 00:58:27,402
Oblige me.

449
00:58:27,469 --> 00:58:30,172
Ye rip it out
and ye swallow it.

450
00:58:33,442 --> 00:58:35,710
You rip it out
and you swallow it.

451
00:58:35,777 --> 00:58:41,416
- Ye rip it out...
- I don't know 'bout that.

452
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:43,885
Y'don't?

453
00:58:43,952 --> 00:58:45,287
I don't.

454
00:58:58,567 --> 00:58:59,702
What?

455
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:04,206
What?

456
00:59:07,675 --> 00:59:08,811
What?

457
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,447
What?

458
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:14,048
What?

459
00:59:14,115 --> 00:59:15,115
- What?
- What?

460
00:59:15,182 --> 00:59:16,217
- What?
- What?

461
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:17,352
- What?
- What?

462
00:59:17,418 --> 00:59:18,652
- What?
- What?

463
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:19,721
- What?
- What?

464
00:59:19,788 --> 00:59:20,889
- What?
- What?

465
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:23,092
What?

466
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,628
- That's what I mean!
- What?

467
00:59:26,695 --> 00:59:29,798
- That's the trouble with you.
- That's the trouble with ye!

468
00:59:29,864 --> 00:59:30,964
- With you!
- With ye!

469
00:59:31,032 --> 00:59:32,134
No!

470
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:34,069
No!

471
00:59:35,103 --> 00:59:37,371
I want a steak!

472
00:59:37,438 --> 00:59:39,707
I want a goddamned steak!

473
00:59:39,775 --> 00:59:41,041
I...

474
00:59:41,108 --> 00:59:43,944
If I had a steak...
Oh, boy!

475
00:59:44,012 --> 00:59:47,016
A... A rare,
a bloody steak.

476
00:59:47,081 --> 00:59:49,484
If I... If I had a steak,

477
00:59:50,619 --> 00:59:52,221
I would fuck it.

478
00:59:57,492 --> 00:59:59,161
You don't like me cookin'?

479
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,297
Ugh, don't be
such an old bitch!

480
01:00:02,731 --> 01:00:03,665
You're drunk!

481
01:00:03,731 --> 01:00:05,266
Ye don't know
what ye're talkin'...

482
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:06,702
How could I possibly like

483
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:08,669
the horse shit
you fix us for supper?

484
01:00:08,737 --> 01:00:11,972
Ye're drunk,
or ye wouldn't be saying that!

485
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:13,442
Them tin kitchen
shanty cooks

486
01:00:13,507 --> 01:00:15,476
gave us fried donuts
three times a day

487
01:00:15,543 --> 01:00:16,978
and country ham
bigger than your fist...

488
01:00:17,045 --> 01:00:18,213
Ye're drunk! Ye're drunk!
Ye're drunk!

489
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,282
- I'm drunk?
- You heard me!

490
01:00:20,349 --> 01:00:22,150
- You've been drunk since...
- Damn ye!

491
01:00:22,217 --> 01:00:24,985
Drunk since I first
laid eyes on you.

492
01:00:25,052 --> 01:00:27,355
Ye're fond of me lobster,
ain't ye?

493
01:00:27,422 --> 01:00:29,290
You're drunker
than a Virginy fence.

494
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,461
I seen it.
Ye're fond of me lobster.

495
01:00:34,829 --> 01:00:36,297
Say it.

496
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,367
Say it.

497
01:00:40,568 --> 01:00:42,103
Say it!

498
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,004
I don't have to say nothin'.

499
01:00:44,072 --> 01:00:45,574
Damn ye!

500
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:50,512
Let Neptune strike ye dead,
Winslow!

501
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:54,416
Hark!

502
01:00:54,483 --> 01:00:58,320
Hark, Triton, Hark!

503
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:03,724
Bellow, bid our father,
the sea king,

504
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:08,297
rise from the depths,
full foul in his fury,

505
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:11,967
black waves teeming
with salt-foam,

506
01:01:12,034 --> 01:01:16,704
to smother this young mouth
with pungent slime,

507
01:01:16,771 --> 01:01:20,442
to choke ye,
engorging yer organs

508
01:01:20,509 --> 01:01:22,711
till ye turn
blue and bloated

509
01:01:22,777 --> 01:01:26,447
with bilge and brine
and can scream no more.

510
01:01:26,514 --> 01:01:31,420
Only when he,
crowned in cockle shells

511
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:36,358
with slithering tentacled tail
and steaming beard,

512
01:01:36,423 --> 01:01:40,228
take up his fell,
be-finned arm,

513
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:43,298
his coral-tined trident
screeches

514
01:01:43,364 --> 01:01:45,600
banshee-like in the tempest

515
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:49,438
and plunges
right through yer gullet,

516
01:01:50,371 --> 01:01:52,272
bursting ye,

517
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,577
a bulging bladder no more,

518
01:01:55,643 --> 01:01:57,978
but a blasted bloody film now,

519
01:01:58,045 --> 01:02:03,518
a nothing for the Harpies
and the souls of dead sailors

520
01:02:03,585 --> 01:02:06,521
to peck and claw
and feed upon,

521
01:02:06,588 --> 01:02:09,792
only to be lapped up
and swallowed

522
01:02:09,858 --> 01:02:11,927
by the infinite waters

523
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:15,898
of the dread emperor himself,

524
01:02:15,963 --> 01:02:18,433
forgotten to any man,

525
01:02:19,768 --> 01:02:21,068
to any time,

526
01:02:21,135 --> 01:02:26,641
forgotten to any God or devil,
forgotten even to the sea,

527
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:30,679
for any stuff
or part of Winslow,

528
01:02:30,746 --> 01:02:33,882
even any scantling
of your soul,

529
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:36,483
is Winslow no more,

530
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:41,657
but is now itself the sea.

531
01:02:49,563 --> 01:02:51,932
All right.
Have it your way.

532
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,635
I like your cooking.

533
01:04:20,956 --> 01:04:22,124
Bitch.

534
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:50,179
Queer way
to wear yer shoes.

535
01:05:54,048 --> 01:05:56,784
Just didn't wanna wake you,
is all.

536
01:05:59,253 --> 01:06:00,889
It's a long night.

537
01:06:01,989 --> 01:06:02,923
And such.

538
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:06,527
Hmm. The sun is
over the yardarm.

539
01:06:06,594 --> 01:06:07,928
Best find me some winks

540
01:06:07,996 --> 01:06:10,965
afore the day
draws farther on.

541
01:06:14,534 --> 01:06:16,737
Get back to yer duties

542
01:06:16,804 --> 01:06:19,640
or I'll give you
a real keelhauling.

543
01:06:32,019 --> 01:06:34,690
You ain't even human no more.

544
01:06:35,989 --> 01:06:39,760
Workin' apart
from folks so long.

545
01:06:39,827 --> 01:06:41,562
You're only tolerable
when you're drunk.

546
01:06:41,628 --> 01:06:43,731
Get to work, says I!

547
01:06:44,298 --> 01:06:45,733

Get off me!
Get off me!

577
01:12:02,984 --> 01:12:05,687
- Thomas.
- Aye.

578
01:12:05,753 --> 01:12:08,489
- It's Thomas.
- Aye.

579
01:12:09,122 --> 01:12:12,426
No, I... I'm Thomas.

580
01:12:12,493 --> 01:12:15,197
I'm Thomas. You're Ephraim.

581
01:12:16,631 --> 01:12:18,099
I lied.

582
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,970
Well, I'll be scuppered.

583
01:12:23,604 --> 01:12:27,074
I'm Thomas. Tommy.

584
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:31,045
Tommy?
Tommy Winslow.

585
01:12:31,746 --> 01:12:33,949
No. Tom Howard.

586
01:12:34,814 --> 01:12:37,117
What's Winslow?

587
01:12:37,184 --> 01:12:39,487
- It's nothing.
- Nothing?

588
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,460
Can I trust you?

589
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,463
Don't be spilling
any of yer beans to me.

590
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:50,864
I ain't interested.

591
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:53,501
No. It wasn't
that way, is all...

592
01:12:53,568 --> 01:12:55,235
I see
what you're fixin' to do.

593
01:12:55,302 --> 01:12:57,005
Git me all liquored up...

594
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,707
Ye're guilty conscience
is ever as tiresome-borin'

595
01:12:59,774 --> 01:13:02,510
as any a guilty conscience.

596
01:13:02,577 --> 01:13:04,278
Worse. Worse.

597
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:06,748
It was...
It was a drive, see...

598
01:13:06,814 --> 01:13:12,354
It was... It was a log drive,
and he's raggin' on me.

599
01:13:13,354 --> 01:13:16,690
No...
I see what you're doing.

600
01:13:16,756 --> 01:13:18,025
Nothing.

601
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:21,796
Look, Tom...

602
01:13:21,863 --> 01:13:24,899
Don't be working to twist
words out of my head.

603
01:13:24,966 --> 01:13:27,101
I ain't.

604
01:13:27,167 --> 01:13:30,438
Um, I can't...
I can't do it.

605
01:13:30,505 --> 01:13:34,041
Shut up yer own rag box.

606
01:13:34,108 --> 01:13:38,579
I trust... I trust...
I trust you.

607
01:13:38,645 --> 01:13:40,081
No.

608
01:13:41,649 --> 01:13:44,653
I... I trust you, Tom.

609
01:13:45,485 --> 01:13:47,122
You trust me?

610
01:13:51,158 --> 01:13:53,561
No, I don't
trust you at all.

611
01:14:14,782 --> 01:14:18,386
And I had 'im
handy and helpless.

612
01:14:19,654 --> 01:14:21,089
Alone.

613
01:14:21,822 --> 01:14:24,225
Too far downstream.

614
01:14:26,293 --> 01:14:29,162
And I...
I wanted to do 'im in.

615
01:14:29,229 --> 01:14:31,098
I admit I did.

616
01:14:32,367 --> 01:14:36,237
Seein' the back of his head.

617
01:14:38,171 --> 01:14:41,241
One swipe of the cant hook'd
be all.

618
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:44,311
Uh... It was...

619
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:48,248
I... I didn't...

620
01:14:49,149 --> 01:14:52,087
I didn't... I did not.

621
01:14:54,555 --> 01:14:58,393
The day was long as hell
on that drive.

622
01:14:59,393 --> 01:15:02,297
I was lead-tired.
I admit it.

623
01:15:03,296 --> 01:15:06,233
But I saw him slippin',
not me.

624
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,270
We saw the jam comin'.

625
01:15:10,337 --> 01:15:13,440
I stood and he slipped.

626
01:15:15,109 --> 01:15:18,513
He shouted up.
And I... I just stood there.

627
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,283
"Tom, you dog!"

628
01:15:25,386 --> 01:15:28,622
I just stood there,
is all. Just...

629
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:33,661
Just stood and watched 'im
git swallowed by them logs.

630
01:15:36,296 --> 01:15:39,634
And all I could think
when he was done was,

631
01:15:41,002 --> 01:15:43,405
"I... I could use me
a smoke."

632
01:15:44,971 --> 01:15:46,573
That's it.

633
01:15:48,275 --> 01:15:50,911
So, I packed up
his kit and fixins,

634
01:15:50,978 --> 01:15:53,280
as if they was my own and...

635
01:15:53,347 --> 01:15:58,552
Ephraim Winslow, well, now,
he got a spiffy clean slate.

636
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:00,188
And Thomas Howard,

637
01:16:00,854 --> 01:16:02,323
well, he don't.

638
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:05,292
No prospects.

639
01:16:08,695 --> 01:16:11,800
How else am I gonna
find respectable work?

640
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:18,640
Tom!

641
01:16:23,176 --> 01:16:24,545
Tom!

642
01:16:35,256 --> 01:16:39,427
Why'd
y'spill yer beans, Tommy?

643
01:16:51,238 --> 01:16:54,109
Why'd y'spill yer beans?

644
01:16:59,947 --> 01:17:03,284
Why'd y'spill yer beans?

645
01:18:25,798 --> 01:18:27,167
Don't leave me!

646
01:19:03,671 --> 01:19:05,305
You crazy son-of-a-bitch!

647
01:19:05,372 --> 01:19:07,207
You smashed up the life boat!

648
01:19:07,274 --> 01:19:09,310
Ye're abandoning
yer post!

649
01:19:19,153 --> 01:19:20,554
What're you gonna do?

650
01:19:20,621 --> 01:19:22,722
Send for the lighthouse
establishment?

651
01:19:22,789 --> 01:19:24,057
Certain, says I!

652
01:19:24,123 --> 01:19:27,560
I'll report ye,
I'll bring the inspector up...

653
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:30,630
I'll report you!
I know what you done!

654
01:19:30,698 --> 01:19:34,768
Who's reportin' who?
Ephraim Winslow?

655
01:19:34,835 --> 01:19:36,403
Or Thomas Howard?

656
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:38,372
I know what you done.

657
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:40,508
You killed your second.

658
01:19:44,377 --> 01:19:46,014
Your one-eyed junior man.

659
01:19:48,115 --> 01:19:50,082
I found him.

660
01:19:50,149 --> 01:19:52,052
In the lobster pot.

661
01:19:53,554 --> 01:19:55,657
Said he went mad?

662
01:19:56,556 --> 01:20:00,327
You made him mad
with that charm!

663
01:20:01,261 --> 01:20:02,929
That scrimshaw trinket.

664
01:20:03,863 --> 01:20:06,132
But I broke it, see.

665
01:20:06,199 --> 01:20:07,635
See?

666
01:20:08,335 --> 01:20:09,636
Now I'm free.

667
01:20:09,703 --> 01:20:12,005
I'm free from your designs!

668
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:19,314
And I got it all figured out,

669
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,083
'cept what's the secret
mischief your keepin'...

670
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:23,785
Up there!

671
01:20:24,650 --> 01:20:28,555
Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Tommy.

672
01:20:29,556 --> 01:20:31,625
Last night
you made a confession

673
01:20:31,692 --> 01:20:34,595
'twould make a saint swear.

674
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:36,197
I don't have
nothin' to confess,

675
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:39,132
but you, spillin' yer beans,

676
01:20:39,198 --> 01:20:40,933
look what it's done to ye.

677
01:20:41,001 --> 01:20:42,936
It's made ye mad!

678
01:20:44,136 --> 01:20:45,371
And I knew ye was mad

679
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:48,442
when y'smashed up
that life boat just now,

680
01:20:48,509 --> 01:20:52,447
a-chasing me with an axe,
tryin' to kill Ol' Tom.

681
01:20:54,113 --> 01:20:55,716
Don't ye trust me, Tommy?

682
01:20:59,953 --> 01:21:03,289
Better hand me
the dinner knife ye pocketed.

683
01:21:03,356 --> 01:21:04,992
Y'aint safe with it.

684
01:21:15,703 --> 01:21:17,805
That's a good lad.

685
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,141
Them's government property.

686
01:21:28,748 --> 01:21:31,051
Deducted from yer pay.

687
01:21:32,219 --> 01:21:35,288
Look at yer shiverin'.

688
01:21:35,354 --> 01:21:38,892
Ye're so mad,
y'know not up from down.

689
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:45,565
How long have we been
on this rock?

690
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,468
Five weeks?

691
01:21:47,533 --> 01:21:49,103
Two days?

692
01:21:50,404 --> 01:21:52,206
Where are we?

693
01:21:52,273 --> 01:21:58,813
Help me to recollect,
who are you again, Tommy?

694
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:01,981
I'm probably a figment
of your imagination.

695
01:22:02,048 --> 01:22:07,755
This rock is a figment
of yer imagination, too.

696
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:12,259
Ye're probably wand'rin'
through a grove of tag alders,

697
01:22:12,326 --> 01:22:13,761
up north in Canady,

698
01:22:13,827 --> 01:22:19,699
like a frostbitten maniac
talkin' to yerself,

699
01:22:19,766 --> 01:22:21,836
knee-deep in snow.

700
01:22:45,259 --> 01:22:47,228
I could use me a smoke.

701
01:22:50,197 --> 01:22:51,865
We're outta drink.

702
01:23:25,231 --> 01:23:27,134
Ooh!

703
01:23:27,201 --> 01:23:29,168
Monkey pump!

704
01:24:57,890 --> 01:24:59,893
This place is a sty.

705
01:25:01,895 --> 01:25:03,965
Mornin' to you too.

706
01:25:10,136 --> 01:25:12,538
I wish I could
go for a walk.

707
01:25:12,605 --> 01:25:14,340
Be my guest.

708
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:15,708
You'll get drowned.

709
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:58,913
Fiery pit!

710
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:07,755
Ain't there no justice
left in this world?

711
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:17,965
Thankee.

712
01:27:18,998 --> 01:27:21,135
What's wrong with yer hand?

713
01:27:25,171 --> 01:27:26,773
The other one.

714
01:27:28,774 --> 01:27:31,510
Ye hear o' tetanus?

715
01:27:31,578 --> 01:27:33,980
- Tet-a-nus?
- Yeah.

716
01:27:34,046 --> 01:27:36,082
It started as a sliver of a cut,
is all...

717
01:27:36,149 --> 01:27:37,751
I said I heard of it.

718
01:27:37,818 --> 01:27:39,887
...from the forestaysail
when we shoved off...

719
01:27:39,953 --> 01:27:41,488
- Don't you ever shut up?
- ...but come a fortnight,

720
01:27:41,555 --> 01:27:43,390
- the bosun was a-shakin'.
- Stop.

721
01:27:43,456 --> 01:27:46,493
His jaw locked tighter
than an anchor...

722
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,729
Shut your gum, goddamn it!
I can't hear no more!

723
01:27:49,796 --> 01:27:52,332
What were it
ye accused me of?

724
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:54,968
Y'already told me
y'had me figgerd.

725
01:27:55,903 --> 01:28:00,006
I'm tired
of your damned-fool yarns

726
01:28:00,073 --> 01:28:02,307
and your Cap'n Ahab horseshit.

727
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:05,511
You sound like
a goddamned parody.

728
01:28:05,578 --> 01:28:09,416
Givin' and nagging orders
like a spinster schoolmarm,

729
01:28:09,483 --> 01:28:11,652
and all the while
turning this station

730
01:28:11,719 --> 01:28:13,720
- to the Devil's own rum hole.
- Ye're makin' a fool of yerself.

731
01:28:13,787 --> 01:28:15,956
Well, it's all horseshit,

732
01:28:16,689 --> 01:28:19,826
your leg, and your sea life,

733
01:28:20,426 --> 01:28:22,095
all of it!

734
01:28:22,162 --> 01:28:24,632
And if I hear
one more word of horseshit

735
01:28:24,698 --> 01:28:27,568
coming out of your foul,
rotten tooth,

736
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:29,802
- smelly old mouth...
- Ye...

737
01:28:29,869 --> 01:28:31,471
Shut up your gum, goddamn it!

738
01:28:31,537 --> 01:28:33,940
I ain't finished yet!

739
01:28:34,006 --> 01:28:36,375
You think you're so goddamned
high and mighty

740
01:28:36,443 --> 01:28:39,579
just 'cause you're a
goddamned lighthouse keeper?

741
01:28:39,645 --> 01:28:42,548
Well, you ain't a captain
of no ship and you never was!

742
01:28:42,615 --> 01:28:46,086
You ain't no general,
you ain't no copper,

743
01:28:46,152 --> 01:28:48,956
you ain't the president,
and you ain't my father!

744
01:28:49,021 --> 01:28:51,559
And I'm sick of you
actin' like you is!

745
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:55,662
I'm sick of your laughing,
your snoring,

746
01:28:55,729 --> 01:28:58,530
and your goddamned farts.

747
01:28:58,597 --> 01:29:01,167
Your goddamned...

748
01:29:01,234 --> 01:29:04,872
Goddamn your farts!

749
01:29:04,938 --> 01:29:07,539
You smell like piss,

750
01:29:07,606 --> 01:29:10,144
you smell like jism,

751
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:14,280
like rotten dick,
like curdled foreskin,

752
01:29:14,347 --> 01:29:17,650
like hot onions fucked
a farmyard shit-house.

753
01:29:17,717 --> 01:29:20,153
And I'm sick of your smell.
I'm sick of it!

754
01:29:20,220 --> 01:29:22,056
I'm sick of it,
you goddamned drunk.

755
01:29:22,122 --> 01:29:25,959
You goddamned, no-account,
son-of-a-bitch-bastard liar!

756
01:29:26,024 --> 01:29:27,795
That's what you are!

757
01:29:27,862 --> 01:29:31,931
You're a goddamned,
drunken, horse-shitting,

758
01:29:31,998 --> 01:29:35,068
short, shit liar.

759
01:29:35,469 --> 01:29:37,104
A liar!

760
01:29:42,841 --> 01:29:45,144
Ye have a way with words,
Tommy.

761
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:48,481
Damn you!

762
01:29:51,685 --> 01:29:53,920
Ye're relieved
of yer duties.

763
01:29:56,355 --> 01:29:58,858
No need to tell me,
old timer.

764
01:30:10,636 --> 01:30:12,805
"Assistant slept late."

765
01:30:12,872 --> 01:30:14,740
"Work below standard."

766
01:30:14,807 --> 01:30:17,478
"Attitude hostile."

767
01:30:20,012 --> 01:30:21,715
"Assistant missing."

768
01:30:21,782 --> 01:30:27,354
"Given to habitual self-abuse
in the supply shed."

769
01:30:29,422 --> 01:30:30,490
"Drunk on duty!"

770
01:30:31,557 --> 01:30:32,958
"Assault!"

771
01:30:33,025 --> 01:30:34,359
"Theft!"

772
01:30:34,426 --> 01:30:38,932
"Recommend severance
without pay."

773
01:30:38,998 --> 01:30:41,635
Severance without pay?

774
01:30:43,036 --> 01:30:45,105
You trying to ruin me?

775
01:30:45,771 --> 01:30:47,306
I'm a hard worker.

776
01:30:47,372 --> 01:30:50,309
I am. I work as hard
as any man.

777
01:30:50,377 --> 01:30:52,379
- Ye lie, Thomas.
- Stop it!

778
01:30:52,444 --> 01:30:56,349
Ye lie to yerself,
but y'ain't have the sauce to see it.

779
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:57,651
Please...

780
01:30:59,819 --> 01:31:02,287
Just let me into the light,
old man.

781
01:31:02,354 --> 01:31:04,223
I've learned so much
from you.

782
01:31:04,289 --> 01:31:06,859
Just let me show you.
Another chance.

783
01:31:06,926 --> 01:31:09,561
Forgive and forget, I says.

784
01:31:09,628 --> 01:31:12,532
Just let me
into that lantern, is all.

785
01:31:12,599 --> 01:31:13,800
Don't make me beg...

786
01:31:13,867 --> 01:31:15,168
Or I'll beg.

787
01:31:15,234 --> 01:31:17,570
I'll beg if that's
what you want. I'll beg.

788
01:31:19,038 --> 01:31:20,407
Please!

789
01:31:21,274 --> 01:31:25,078
Please! Please! Please!

790
01:31:25,145 --> 01:31:26,613
Stand down.

791
01:31:28,047 --> 01:31:29,983
You selfish bastard!

792
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:32,586
Keepin' it all to yourself.

793
01:31:32,653 --> 01:31:33,920
You left your old lady,

794
01:31:33,987 --> 01:31:35,855
your children, for what?
For what?

795
01:31:35,921 --> 01:31:42,929
Look at ye, handsome lad,
with eyes bright as a lady.

796
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:46,365
Come to this rock
playin' the tough.

797
01:31:46,432 --> 01:31:49,735
Ye make me laugh
with yer false grum.

798
01:31:49,802 --> 01:31:54,173
Ye pretended to some mystery
in yer quietudes,

799
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:57,644
but there ain't no mystery.

800
01:31:58,645 --> 01:32:00,013
Ye're an open book.

801
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:02,448
A picture, says I.

802
01:32:03,483 --> 01:32:06,953
A painted actress
screaming in the footlights,

803
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:09,089
a bitch what wants
to be coveted

804
01:32:09,155 --> 01:32:10,756
for nothin' but being born,

805
01:32:10,823 --> 01:32:14,228
cryin' bout the silver spoon
what should've been yers.

806
01:32:15,662 --> 01:32:19,466
Now look at ye cryin'.

807
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:22,569
Boo! Boo!

808
01:32:23,235 --> 01:32:25,372
What you gonna do?

809
01:32:26,005 --> 01:32:27,641
Will ye kill me?

810
01:32:28,207 --> 01:32:30,076
Will ye?

811
01:32:30,143 --> 01:32:32,345
Will y'kill me
like y'done that gull?

812
01:32:32,412 --> 01:32:34,581
- I didn't...
- Liar!

813
01:32:34,646 --> 01:32:36,114
Y'murdering dog!

814
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:39,152
Twas ye what changed
the wind on us.

815
01:32:39,219 --> 01:32:41,887
Twas ye what damned us, dog.
Twas ye!

816
01:32:41,954 --> 01:32:46,225
Will y'do what y'wish
y'done to Ol' Winslow?

817
01:32:46,292 --> 01:32:49,795
Will ye best me then?
For Winslow were right!

818
01:32:49,863 --> 01:32:52,131
Thomas, ye're a dog!

819
01:32:52,198 --> 01:32:55,168
A filthy dog! A dog!

820
01:34:14,881 --> 01:34:16,682
Ye're killing me!

821
01:34:57,090 --> 01:34:58,559
Bark.

822
01:35:03,095 --> 01:35:04,764
Bark, boy.

823
01:35:06,365 --> 01:35:08,202
Bark, laddy.

824
01:35:09,869 --> 01:35:11,238
Bark.

825
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:16,309
Woof.

826
01:35:16,376 --> 01:35:19,011
Ain't ye never been
to sea before?

827
01:35:19,078 --> 01:35:21,180
Bark, I says. Bark!

828
01:35:21,247 --> 01:35:24,084
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

829
01:35:24,150 --> 01:35:26,385
Bark, laddy!

830
01:35:26,453 --> 01:35:29,222
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

831
01:35:29,287 --> 01:35:31,490
- Now, there's a good boy.
- Ruff!

832
01:35:32,457 --> 01:35:33,726
There's a good dog.

833
01:35:33,793 --> 01:35:36,796
Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

834
01:35:37,997 --> 01:35:39,365
Ruff!

835
01:35:40,265 --> 01:35:41,902
Now roll over.

836
01:35:58,818 --> 01:36:00,386
Come on.

837
01:36:00,453 --> 01:36:02,689
Come on.

838
01:36:11,697 --> 01:36:13,867
Git!

839
01:36:37,122 --> 01:36:38,591
Get up here.

840
01:36:56,542 --> 01:36:59,446
Good boy. Good boy.

841
01:37:00,512 --> 01:37:03,350
Now you git in there,
where you belong.

842
01:37:04,716 --> 01:37:06,719
You do as I say, dog.

843
01:37:11,623 --> 01:37:13,460
There's my good lad.

844
01:37:27,907 --> 01:37:31,877
Ye wish to see
what's in the lantern?

845
01:37:33,445 --> 01:37:35,247
So did me last assistant.

846
01:37:35,314 --> 01:37:36,949
Shut up, old dog!

847
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:40,653
Polish your brasswork.

848
01:37:42,121 --> 01:37:47,426
O what Protean forms swim up
from men's minds,

849
01:37:47,493 --> 01:37:51,297
and melt in
hot Promethean plunder,

850
01:37:51,363 --> 01:37:52,798
scorching eyes,

851
01:37:52,865 --> 01:37:55,735
with divine shames
and horror...

852
01:37:57,104 --> 01:38:02,208
And casting them down
to Davy Jones.

853
01:38:02,274 --> 01:38:05,978
The others, still blind,

854
01:38:06,045 --> 01:38:09,015
yet in it see

855
01:38:09,081 --> 01:38:14,220
all the divine graces

856
01:38:14,287 --> 01:38:18,725
and to Fiddler's Green sent,

857
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:24,864
where no man is suffered
to want or toil,

858
01:38:24,930 --> 01:38:26,098
but is...

859
01:38:27,399 --> 01:38:28,768
Ancient...

860
01:38:30,069 --> 01:38:33,140
Mutable and unchanging

861
01:38:34,474 --> 01:38:40,614
as the she who girdles
'round the globe.

862
01:38:42,081 --> 01:38:43,516
Them's truth.

863
01:38:45,018 --> 01:38:46,418
You'll be punished.

864
01:40:15,841 --> 01:40:18,076
The light belongs to me!

865
01:41:09,962 --> 01:41:12,965
Should pale death
with treble dread

866
01:41:13,032 --> 01:41:15,769
make the ocean caves
our bed,

867
01:41:16,969 --> 01:41:19,572
God who hear'st
the surges roll,

868
01:41:19,639 --> 01:41:22,342
deign to save
the suppliant soul.
